# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Prediction

Machine Learning project for predicting the probability of diabetic patient readmission within 30 days after hospital discharge.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model explainability
- Streamlit deployment

> ⚠️ Educational project only. This system is not intended for clinical decision-making.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Hospital readmissions create additional healthcare costs and may indicate potential gaps in patient care.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that estimates the likelihood of diabetic patients being readmitted within 30 days after discharge.

The prediction can help identify higher-risk cases that may require additional follow-up attention.

# 📊 Dataset

**UCI Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset**

Dataset information:

- 101,766 patient encounters
- 50 original features
- Data collected from 130 US hospitals

Target:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | Readmitted within 30 days (`<30`) |
| 0 | Not readmitted within 30 days |

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fewer positive readmission cases.

# 🔄 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

## Removed high missing-value columns

Removed:

- `weight`
- `medical_specialty`
- `payer_code`

## Missing Value Handling

- Replace missing race values (`?`) with `Unknown`
- Remove records with missing diagnosis codes

Removed rows containing:

- `diag_1 = ?`
- `diag_2 = ?`
- `diag_3 = ?`

## Removed Identifier Features

Removed:

- `encounter_id`
- `patient_nbr`

## Feature Transformation

### Numerical Features

Pipeline:

```
Median Imputation
```

### Categorical Features

Pipeline:

```
Most Frequent Imputation

        v
One-Hot Encoding
(handle_unknown="ignore")
```

# 🤖 Machine Learning Model

## Random Forest Classifier

Model configuration:

```
n_estimators = 300
max_depth = 15
min_samples_split = 20
class_weight = balanced
random_state = 42
```

The model outputs:

- Readmission probability
- Risk classification based on prediction threshold

---

# 📈 Model Performance

Evaluation was performed using a test set (20%).

## ROC-AUC Score

```
ROC-AUC: 0.652
```

The performance is affected by several factors:

- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fewer positive readmission cases.
- Patient readmission depends on complex clinical factors that may not be fully represented by available features.
- Random Forest provides a strong baseline, but gradient boosting models may improve performance.

Accuracy alone may not represent performance correctly when one class has significantly fewer samples.

# 🔍 Model Explainability

Feature importance is extracted from the Random Forest model.

The training process generates:

```
models/feature_importance.csv
```

and visualization:

![Feature Importance](screenshots/feature_importance.png)


The feature importance shows which variables contributed most to the model's decision process.

Future improvement:

- SHAP explanation
- Local prediction explanation
- Feature contribution analysis

# 🖥️ Streamlit Application

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit.

Application features:

✅ Patient information input  
✅ Readmission probability prediction  
✅ Risk assessment visualization  
✅ Model explainability support  

The Streamlit application restricts user inputs within the observed training ranges using UI constraints such as sliders and dropdowns.

Categorical features are handled with OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"), allowing unseen categories without crashing the pipeline.
